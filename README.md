This is the alpha version of the project so I'm excited to update it with more features down the road. Currently, it has got two arduino modules. The first one ( main_module) is the receiver and it has only an NRF24L01 connected to it. The second one ( keypad_module) Has the radio module with a 4x4 matrix keypad that is used to enter a passcode that starts with '*' and ends with '#'.  If the passcode is equal to the one in the receiver, it prints "FrntKpd" ( because I imagine using it at the front door or front gate). 
The connections are shown in the code and I'm not going to write them down, as I'm going to update the master branch as much as possible.
If there are any questions, don't hesitate to message me.
